# Project Log
This document is to keep track of my thoughts and progress over time.

## Day 1:
After reading the project requirements, I thought the easiest way to approach this project would be to use frequency to encode the text. I will select the text I'm going to use and assign a frequency to each character, then transfer the text to an acoustic signal.

The characters I'm going to need include letters 'a-z', capital letters 'A-Z', numbers '0-9', and maybe common punctuation marks. After some investigation, I found it easier to just use the ASCII system. The commonly used letters, numbers, and punctuation marks will be from number 32 to 122, and the characters can be expressed using 7-digit binary coding.
